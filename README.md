# Entelechy

**Entelechy** is a foundational research repository exploring principles of mind, embodiment, and evolution. This project combines conceptual, empirical, and computational approaches to understand the conditions under which agency and complex cognition emerge in biological systems.

## Overview

This repository supports ongoing research into:
- Evolutionary and biological anthropology
- Embodied cognition and extended mind theories
- Theoretical models of self-organizing systems and agency
- Empirical data analyses and modeling pipelines

## Contents

- `/data/` – Raw and processed data files (de-identified where appropriate)
- `/scripts/` – R and Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization
- `/models/` – Computational models and simulations
- `/docs/` – Supporting documents, references, and notes
- `README.md` – Project description and setup instructions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R (≥ 4.0) with packages: `lme4`, `tidyverse`, `ggeffects`, `brms` (for Bayesian modeling)
- Python (≥ 3.8) with packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` (if used)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
